## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

Creating a seller account on Shoplite is a structured process designed to protect buyers and maintain marketplace trust. Sellers must complete the seller registration process, which begins by providing accurate business information such as legal business name, tax ID, business address,
and banking details. Shoplite performs business verification to ensure that each seller is a legitimate
entity and complies with local regulations, financial reporting, and tax obligations. Verification
typically takes 2-3 business days, during which Shoplite may request additional documents, such as
government-issued IDs, business licenses, or proof of tax registration. Sellers can track the status
of their verification at every step. Only after successful verification can a seller begin listing
products and accepting orders. The system is intentionally designed to avoid instant approval,
and personal accounts cannot be used for seller operations to ensure accountability. During onboarding,
step-by-step guidance is provided to ensure sellers understand their obligations, including compliance
with Shoplite’s seller policies, dispute resolution mechanisms, and marketplace standards. Completing
seller registration and verification ensures that buyers can trust the products offered, protects
financial transactions, and maintains the integrity of Shoplite’s platform. Sellers are encouraged
to carefully follow all instructions and provide complete documentation to avoid delays in the 2-3
business day verification process. This approach balances efficiency with security, enabling sellers
to operate confidently while preserving the marketplace ecosystem.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

Shoplite’s return and refund system is designed to protect both buyers and sellers while
maintaining clarity and fairness. Most items are covered under a standard 30-day return window, which
begins from the date of delivery. Buyers seeking to return items must request a return authorization
through their order page and follow the seller’s instructions for preparing and shipping the return.
The system integrates order tracking through carrier APIs, ensuring that buyers can monitor the progress
of both shipments and returns. Sellers are expected to approve or reject return requests promptly;
disputes may be escalated to Shoplite arbitration if necessary. Once a return is authorized and the
item has been received and inspected, refunds are issued to the original payment method. Shoplite
emphasizes the importance of adhering to the 30-day return window; policies such as lifetime returns
are not supported. The combination of return authorization, structured seller instructions, and
automated order tracking ensures that the return process is transparent and reduces errors or disputes.
Buyers can also view return status and tracking information in their order history, creating a seamless
and predictable experience. Sellers are encouraged to communicate clearly, follow all platform guidelines,
and maintain high standards of item description and packaging to reduce returns and disputes.

## Document 3: Shoplite Checkout and Payment Flow

Shoplite takes payment security seriously to protect buyers and sellers. All transactions
are processed using PCI-compliant payment processors, and sensitive payment information is tokenized
to prevent unauthorized access. Card numbers, bank account details, and other credentials are never
stored directly on Shoplite servers. Fraud prevention is implemented through multiple layers, including
device fingerprinting, velocity checks to monitor unusual transaction patterns, and risk scoring to
evaluate transaction legitimacy. The platform supports multiple payment methods, including credit cards,
PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, with seamless integration into the checkout flow. Multi-seller orders
are split programmatically, ensuring that each seller receives the correct portion of the payment, while
Shoplite retains its commission. These processes are carefully monitored and logged for audit purposes.
Machine learning algorithms detect potentially fraudulent activity in real-time, allowing Shoplite to
intervene before funds are released. Sellers are notified of high-risk orders or potential chargebacks.
By combining PCI-compliant systems, tokenization, and robust fraud prevention measures, Shoplite
ensures that payments are processed securely, efficiently, and with minimal risk to all parties
involved. This comprehensive approach protects both buyers’ financial information and sellers’ revenues,
while maintaining trust across the marketplace.

## Document 4: Shoplite Shipping and Delivery System

Shoplite provides a shopping cart system that allows items to be saved and accessed across
multiple devices, ensuring a seamless shopping experience. Authenticated users have their carts persisted
across devices in real-time, allowing them to start shopping on a desktop, continue on a mobile device,
and finalize purchases on a tablet without losing items. For guest users, items are stored in cookies,
and when the user logs in, these items are merged at login with any existing cart contents. This ensures
that no selected item is lost and prevents duplication or loss of stock availability. The cart system
also includes features such as quantity adjustments, item removal, automated price recalculation with
discounts, tax estimation, and shipping cost calculations. Real-time synchronization with inventory
prevents checkout errors caused by out-of-stock items. Multi-seller support allows items from different
vendors to be combined seamlessly, maintaining an accurate cart state across all sessions. The system
is designed for reliability, user convenience, and to enhance conversion by reducing friction during
checkout. Cart persistence across devices increases engagement, provides a consistent experience, and
aligns inventory, payment state, and session management across all Shoplite platforms.

## Document 5: Shoplite Order Management

Shoplite provides a standardized seller payout schedule to ensure transparency and
predictability for sellers. Payouts are typically made on a net-7 basis, meaning funds from completed
transactions are disbursed seven days after settlement. Sellers are required to complete business
verification before receiving payouts, which includes confirmation of banking details, tax ID, and
legal business registration. New sellers or those with pending verification may experience temporary
holds on payouts until compliance is confirmed. Multi-seller orders are processed to split payments
programmatically, ensuring each seller receives their accurate share while Shoplite retains the
appropriate commission. Sellers can monitor pending, completed, and scheduled payouts through the
vendor dashboard, providing full visibility into transaction flows. The payout process is designed to
balance timely access to funds with fraud prevention and operational integrity. By maintaining a
verification step and adhering to the net-7 schedule, Shoplite ensures that sellers are paid promptly
while minimizing risk. Clear communication, detailed reporting, and a structured payout workflow create
confidence for sellers and support long-term marketplace sustainability.

## Document 6: Shoplite Returns and Refunds Policy

Shoplite has established a structured support flow to allow sellers and buyers
to report suspected fraudulent orders. When a potentially fraudulent order is identified, users
must provide detailed order information through the customer support interface. The submitted
case is triaged by Shoplite’s dedicated fraud team, which assesses the risk level using historical
data, machine-learning risk scoring, and rule-based checks. High-risk orders may be held for
verification before shipment or payment release. The fraud team works closely with payment
processors and internal monitoring systems to ensure that fraudulent activities are intercepted
efficiently. Sellers are notified about actions taken and may be asked to provide additional
documentation or evidence to aid in the investigation. Shoplite also tracks patterns of repeated
suspicious behavior, allowing proactive measures to prevent future fraud. The support flow ensures
that reports are handled systematically, transparently, and in compliance with PCI-DSS and
consumer protection regulations. Users are encouraged to report any abnormal transactions promptly,
and the fraud team prioritizes high-risk cases to minimize financial losses for both buyers and sellers.
By integrating a structured support flow, dedicated fraud team, and triaging mechanisms, Shoplite
maintains marketplace trust, mitigates risks, and ensures that legitimate transactions proceed safely.

## Document 7: Shoplite Product Listing Guidelines

Shoplite provides REST API access for developers and enterprise clients, allowing
integration with inventory, orders, and payment reconciliation. API keys are required for authentication,
and each key is subject to rate limits to ensure system stability and fair usage across all clients.
Details of rate limits depend on the API key tier and can be found in the official API documentation.
Developers are strongly encouraged to implement exponential backoff strategies when requests exceed
thresholds, to reduce throttling and maintain operational continuity. The API supports endpoints for
product uploads, inventory updates, order retrieval, and payout tracking. SDKs for popular languages
including Python, Java, and JavaScript provide additional convenience for integrating with Shoplite’s
platform. Error handling, logging, and monitoring are recommended best practices to ensure reliable
API consumption. By enforcing rate limits, validating API keys, and using exponential backoff strategies,
Shoplite protects platform integrity while enabling developers to build scalable, automated solutions
efficiently and safely.

## Document 8: Shoplite Vendor Dashboard

Shoplite requires that returns are always authorized before shipment back to the seller.
Buyers must request return authorization through their order page, providing reasons and supporting
evidence such as photos for defective or misrepresented items. Once authorized, the item must be
shipped according to seller instructions. Upon receipt, the item undergoes inspection to verify
condition, completeness, and compliance with the return policy. Refunds are then issued to the original
payment method, and processing may take several business days depending on the payment provider.
Shoplite monitors all returns and refunds to ensure sellers comply with policies and maintain quality
standards. Unauthorized returns are rejected, and buyers are guided through the correct procedures.
The system integrates with order tracking and buyer notifications to maintain transparency throughout
the process. Returns and refunds management includes auditing logs, dispute resolution support, and
fraud detection to prevent misuse. By combining return authorization, inspection, and structured
refund issuance, Shoplite ensures buyers are protected while sellers can manage returns efficiently,
preserving trust across the marketplace ecosystem.

## Document 9: Shoplite Inventory Management

Shoplite enables sellers to manage inventory programmatically through multiple
channels. The REST API allows real-time updates to product availability, pricing, and descriptions.
Sellers can also perform bulk updates using CSV uploads, which simplifies large-scale inventory
management for extensive catalogs. Webhooks provide notifications about changes in orders, stock
levels, or product status, allowing external systems to synchronize automatically. Integration with
inventory management software or ERP systems is supported, ensuring accurate, consistent data
across multiple sales channels. The platform validates data to prevent overselling or inconsistent
inventory states. Sellers are advised to monitor webhook logs and API responses for errors and
confirmation of successful updates. The combination of REST API, CSV uploads, and webhooks empowers
sellers to efficiently control stock, respond to market demand, and maintain accurate product
availability information for buyers. By leveraging these tools, Shoplite ensures operational efficiency,
minimizes order errors, and supports scalable growth for sellers of all sizes

Sellers may specify exceptions, which are clearly communicated in product listings. During this window,
buyers can request return authorization, follow instructions for returning items, and receive refunds
after inspection. The 30-day return window balances buyer protection with operational efficiency for
sellers, reducing long-term disputes and maintaining marketplace trust. Shoplite integrates tracking
systems and notifications to guide buyers through the return process, ensuring transparency and
accountability. By standardizing the 30-day return window, Shoplite establishes predictable rules

provided to prevent account lockout. Enabling 2FA strengthens account security, safeguards buyer
information, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive seller and buyer data.
