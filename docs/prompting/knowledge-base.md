## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

The user registration process on Shoplite is designed to be both user-friendly for buyers and rigorous enough for merchants who will sell on the platform. New users begin by visiting the registration page where they choose either a buyer account or a seller account. A buyer account focuses on personal details (name, email, optional phone number) and user preferences, while a seller account triggers an expanded onboarding flow collecting business name, legal entity type, tax identification numbers, and the primary contact's government-issued ID.

To reduce fraud and improve trust, Shoplite requires email verification: after sign-up, a verification email containing a time-limited, single-use token is sent and must be activated within 24 hours. Password rules require a minimum of eight characters including at least one uppercase letter, one numeric digit, and one special character; password strength meters guide users during entry. For account recovery, Shoplite uses one-time reset links that expire after 15 minutes and implements rate limits to prevent abuse. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available via TOTP apps (e.g., Authenticator) and SMS as a backup; the platform strongly recommends enabling MFA, especially for seller accounts that handle funds and payouts.

Seller verification is multi-stage: automated checks validate business registrations and tax IDs where APIs are available; for higher-risk profiles (high-volume sellers or high-ticket categories), Shoplite requests supplemental documents for manual review — business license, bank account proof, and identity verification for the store owner. Verification status is reflected in the seller dashboard and affects features such as payout scheduling and promotional eligibility. Incomplete or suspicious accounts are placed into conditional states where certain actions (e.g., listing high-value items, withdrawing payouts) are restricted until verification completes.

Privacy and consent are emphasized during signup: Shoplite surfaces core policy summaries, cookie preferences, and options to receive marketing communications. Account deletion is initiated from the account settings page and requires confirmation with an optional exit survey to collect feedback; deletion triggers data retention flows consistent with legal requirements and business needs (e.g., transactional history kept for financial reconciliation). Overall, Shoplite’s registration balances speed for buyers and the due diligence necessary for sellers to maintain marketplace safety and regulatory compliance.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

The Shoplite shopping cart is engineered to support multi-seller marketplaces while providing a seamless, customer-focused experience. At its core the cart enables users to collect items from different sellers in a single, unified checkout session while keeping seller-specific details—like shipping and return policies—clearly visible. For authenticated users, cart state is persisted on the server and synchronized across devices so a shopper can start on mobile and complete checkout on desktop. For anonymous or guest shoppers, cart state is preserved using a secure, encrypted cookie; once they sign up or log in, the server-side merge process reconciles the cookie-based cart with any existing saved cart in their account, resolving conflicts by timestamp or explicit user choice.

Key user interactions include quantity edits, variant selection, per-item notes to sellers (for special handling), and a save-for-later list. The UI surface highlights per-seller subtotals, estimated shipping and tax, and any seller-specific promotions. Promotional codes can be added at the cart level or item level depending on merchant configuration; Shoplite validates coupon eligibility both at addition time and again during the pre-charge validation step to prevent mid-checkout errors and race conditions with inventory adapters.

The cart also implements performance and reliability features for marketplaces: optimistic quantity updates are shown immediately to the user while the system performs background validation with inventory and pricing microservices; if a conflict appears (e.g., quantity exceeds available stock), the user is prompted with options to adjust or remove the item. To reduce friction, Shoplite supports a cart auto-save mechanism and expiration policies for guest carts to avoid stale data.

From an engineering standpoint, the cart service exposes idempotent APIs for adding, updating, and merging carts, with hooks for analytics and A/B testing. It integrates with the pricing service for dynamic shipping calculations, tax estimation, and multi-currency displays. For merchants, the cart can surface seller-level options such as fulfillment type (merchant-fulfilled vs. drop-ship), expedited shipping offerings, and gift packaging. Operational safeguards include rate limits, transactional integrity for checkout, and reconciliation jobs that regularly sweep and reconcile carts with inventory and payment state.

## Document 3: Shoplite Checkout and Payment Flow

The checkout flow on Shoplite aims to balance conversion with security and compliance. A streamlined multi-step flow guides customers through address confirmation, shipping option selection, payment method entry, and a final review page that summarizes charges, taxes, and shipping. Shoplite supports multiple payment methods including major credit and debit cards, digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and platform gift credit or promotional balance. Payment methods are tokenized using a PCI-compliant vault provided by an external payment processor; Shoplite never stores full card numbers, limiting scope and simplifying PCI compliance.

During checkout, tax and shipping estimates are computed in real-time: tax calculation integrates with a tax service or rules engine which considers destination jurisdiction and applicable product tax categories; shipping estimates call carrier or fulfillment adapter services to present options and rates. Fraud prevention checks — velocity checks, device fingerprinting, and basic behavioral heuristics — run in parallel to the authorization step; when a transaction is flagged, the checkout can trigger additional verification steps like email confirmation, SMS OTP, or manual review depending on risk scoring thresholds.

Guest checkout is supported to minimize friction, but the flow encourages account creation by highlighting benefits: saved addresses, faster repeat purchases, and order history. For sellers, the payout process is separate from customer payments: funds are captured by the payment processor and settled to Shoplite’s merchant account; seller payouts are then calculated by subtracting commissions and fees, with scheduling (typically net-7 for verified sellers) and potential holds for newly onboarded or flagged sellers. Refunds and chargebacks are handled through a reconciliation process that updates seller balances and applies adjustments according to the dispute outcome.

Operationally, Shoplite implements idempotent payment capture APIs and robust webhook handling to manage asynchronous events from payment processors. There are clear audit logs for each payment event and reconciliations runs that match payments with orders and payouts. Overall, the checkout is designed to be resilient, auditable, and optimized for conversion while maintaining the controls needed to minimize fraud and protect sensitive financial data.

## Document 4: Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite’s payment architecture combines flexibility for customers with strong security guarantees. The platform supports a broad set of payment methods—card networks, digital wallets, and alternative payment methods depending on region (e.g., local bank redirects or direct debit options). Payment method configuration is abstracted behind a payments gateway layer that enables feature toggles for new payment rails and allows routing through multiple processors for redundancy and cost optimization.

Security is implemented using a layered approach. Card and payment credentials are never stored in plain text; tokenization delegates storage to certified payment vaults that provide PCI-DSS compliance. Communications between Shoplite and payment processors are protected using TLS and signed webhook verification to prevent replay attacks. To detect and mitigate fraud, the payments pipeline integrates device fingerprinting, geolocation checks, BIN-based heuristics, velocity limits, and machine-learning risk models. Transactions that exceed risk thresholds feed into a review queue where analysts can request additional verification from customers.

Dispute and refund flows are formalized: merchants and buyers can request refunds from the order management UI; refund requests are validated against order status, return authorizations, and seller policies. When an issuer-level chargeback occurs, Shoplite collects evidence (transaction logs, delivery confirmation, customer communication) and provides a structured interface for sellers and support teams to respond. Successful chargebacks result in adjustments to seller balances, which are reconciled during payout cycles.

From an operational perspective, Shoplite monitors payment success rates and tracks trends such as processor decline reasons, geographic decline patterns, and chargeback ratios. There are automated alerts for spikes in declines or fraud signals. Security controls include role-based access controls (RBAC) for payment administration, regular key rotation, penetration testing, and compliance audits. These combined measures ensure that Shoplite can offer diverse payment options while maintaining the security and trust customers expect.

## Document 5: Order Tracking and Delivery

Order tracking on Shoplite is designed to provide transparency across the full fulfillment lifecycle, from shipment creation to delivery confirmation. After an order is confirmed, Shoplite integrates with carrier APIs and fulfillment providers to create shipment objects and capture tracking numbers. The customer-facing experience shows estimated delivery windows (calculated from carrier transit times and seller processing times), real-time status updates (e.g., shipped, in transit, out for delivery, delivered), and expected delivery dates that account for business days and local holidays.

For marketplaces with multiple sellers in a single order, Shoplite represents tracking per-seller so customers can see which items are arriving together and which are shipped separately. Notifications—email, SMS, and in-app—are configurable by the user and triggered at key lifecycle events: shipment creation, out-for-delivery, delivery confirmation, and exception events such as delivery failure or delayed transit.

The platform supports advanced delivery scenarios including split shipments, partially fulfilled orders, and carrier-initiated status updates. Shoplite consumes webhooks from carriers to update the internal order tracking state and to notify customers proactively. In the event of delivery issues, Shoplite provides support workflows: customers can initiate a missing item claim, request redelivery, or kick off a return depending on the seller’s policy.

Operationally, Shoplite reconciles tracking events during nightly or incremental jobs to match carrier updates with order items and to compute performance metrics like on-time delivery rate and average transit time. Sellers receive dashboards that show fulfillment performance, late shipments, and exceptions that may impact their marketplace ranking. The system also integrates with return logistics to create return labels and track inbound return shipments when necessary.

---

## Document 6: Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite maintains a standardized returns and refunds framework while allowing sellers to define category-specific exceptions. The platform’s default policy is a 30-day return window for most items; returns are initiated through the order details page where customers can request an authorization, choose a return reason, and print a pre-paid label if the seller offers one. For certain categories—perishables or personalized goods—sellers may restrict returns and set alternative handling rules.

When a return is requested, Shoplite validates eligibility based on the product category, purchase date, and condition. The platform supports multiple return workflows: seller-managed returns (the seller receives the returned item and processes the refund) and platform-assisted returns (Shoplite provides logistics support and handles the inspection and refund for the buyer). Returns are tracked through inbound shipment tracking and inspected upon receipt by either the seller or a Shoplite-managed returns facility.

Once a return is approved and processed, refunds are issued to the original payment method; timing varies by payment provider and bank processing times. For sellers, the refund operation adjusts their balance and may affect payout schedules if refunds occur shortly after a payout has settled. To reduce fraud, Shoplite uses heuristics and manual review for high-risk return patterns (e.g., frequent returns from the same account, suspicious routing addresses).

Exchanges and replacements are supported where applicable. The returns module integrates with inventory to re-shelve accepted returns and update availability automatically. For transparency, customers receive email updates at each stage of the return lifecycle and can view return status in their account. Reporting features allow merchants to analyze return rates, reasons, and costs by SKU, category, and timeframe to inform policy or product decisions.

---

## Document 7: Product Reviews and Ratings

Product reviews and ratings are central to buyer trust on Shoplite. After delivery confirmation, customers are invited to leave a review and star rating. The review experience asks for a short textual review and optional attributes such as product fit, quality, and delivery experience. Shoplite encourages high-quality feedback by prompting for pros/cons and optional photo uploads while minimizing friction to post reviews.

To maintain content quality, Shoplite applies a moderation pipeline that combines automated filters and human review. Automated checks detect spam, profanity, personally identifiable information, and potential promotional content; flagged items are either removed automatically or routed to moderators depending on the severity. Verified purchase badges are added to reviews that can be traced to a completed transaction, helping readers identify trustworthy feedback.

Merchants may respond publicly to reviews to address concerns, provide clarifications, or thank customers for feedback. However, merchants cannot directly delete reviews — removal requests go through a moderation team and must meet policy criteria (e.g., review contains false accusations or violates content rules). Appeal processes exist for sellers who believe a review was incorrectly moderated.

Shoplite also surfaces reviewer reputation signals and historical helpfulness, allowing the ranking algorithm to prioritize useful reviews. Analytics dashboards provide merchants with aggregated insights such as average rating by product, distribution of ratings, and common themes extracted via NLP. These signals inform merchandising and product improvement efforts. Overall, the reviews system balances openness with safeguards to ensure reviews remain a reliable source of product information.

## Document 8: Seller Account Setup and Management

Seller onboarding is a multi-step process designed to verify legitimacy while minimizing friction. Prospective sellers start with an application capturing business details, tax identifiers, bank account info for payouts, and documents required for identity verification. Automated checks verify tax IDs and business registrations when integrations are available; otherwise, manual review workflows are triggered.

Upon approval, sellers receive access to a dashboard that centralizes inventory management, order processing, shipping profile configuration, and financial reporting. The dashboard includes tools for bulk product uploads, price management, and promotion creation. Sellers can configure fulfillment preferences (merchant-fulfilled versus Shoplite-fulfilled where available), shipping zones, and return policies.

Verification tiers govern available features and payouts. Basic verification grants listing and basic selling abilities, while advanced verification (proof of identity, business license, and bank account validation) unlocks faster payout schedules, higher listing limits, and access to marketing programs. Sellers have access to performance metrics—on-time shipping, cancellation rate, and customer satisfaction—that can affect visibility and eligibility for certain marketplace programs.

Account management includes role-based access for multi-user teams, allowing business owners to invite staff and set permissions for inventory, order handling, and financial views. Suspensions and policy enforcement are handled through a combination of automated rule engines and human review; sellers can appeal decisions through an established dispute resolution channel. The system supports API keys for automation and webhooks for real-time events, enabling integration with external ERPs and shipping providers.

---

## Document 9: Inventory Management for Sellers

Inventory management in Shoplite is designed to handle both small merchants and large, multi-SKU sellers with complex variation structures. Sellers can manage inventory from the dashboard via single-item updates, bulk CSV uploads, or programmatically through the REST API. The platform supports per-variation inventory (size, color, material), and SKU-level stock keeping, and allows sellers to configure thresholds for low-stock alerts and automatic reordering.

For high-volume sellers, Shoplite provides integrations with external inventory management systems and supports webhooks for near real-time synchronization. To handle spikes in traffic or large catalog updates, the system performs background reconciliation jobs that compare reported inventory across external systems and the platform, resolving conflicts using configurable rules (e.g., last-write-wins, prioritized source).

The inventory service supports advanced features such as backorders, pre-orders, and inventory reservations for pending orders. Inventory reservations ensure that once a checkout is initiated, a temporary hold reduces the available quantity for a short window to prevent overselling; these holds expire if the checkout does not complete. For multi-warehouse sellers, Shoplite tracks stock by location and routes orders according to fulfillment rules and proximity to customer to optimize shipping cost and delivery time.

Operational tools include auditing and tracing for inventory changes, role-based access for inventory operations, and batch processing for large-scale updates. Sellers can run reports to analyze stock turnover, days-of-inventory, and identify slow-moving SKUs. The platform also offers scheduled or event-triggered replenishment alerts and integrations with procurement systems to automate restocking from preferred suppliers.

---

## Document 10: Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite’s fee model combines marketplace commissions, optional service fees, and tiered pricing for value-added services. The baseline commission is a percentage of the sale price and may vary by category; additional, optional fees (e.g., listing boosts, promotional placement) are charged separately and itemized on seller invoices. Commission rates and applicable fees are disclosed during onboarding and accessible in the seller agreement to ensure transparency.

Commission calculation occurs at settlement time: when a buyer’s payment is captured, Shoplite records the transaction and calculates fees and commission based on the order composition, any applicable discounts, and promotions. Payouts to sellers reflect the net amount after these deductions and after applying returns, refunds, or chargebacks that might impact settled funds. For subscription or recurring billing models, commissions can be configured to apply per billing cycle.

Financial reconciliations are performed regularly to ensure that collected fees match payouts and accounting records. Sellers receive periodic statements and invoices that detail gross sales, platform fees, payment processing fees, refunds, and net payout amounts. For transparency, the platform offers an API and dashboard views where sellers can query transaction-level details and export reports for accounting integration.

In addition to standard commissions, Shoplite may offer incentive programs—reduced fees for high-volume sellers, promotional credits, or co-investment in advertising for top-performing merchants. These programs are governed by clear eligibility rules and are reflected in the seller’s dashboard when applicable. Overall, the fee system is designed to be predictable while enabling marketplace growth through promotional and tiered pricing programs.

---

## Document 11: Customer Support Procedures

Shoplite provides multi-channel customer support to balance scalability with personalized service. For general inquiries and low-severity issues, self-service resources (help center articles, FAQs, and chatbots) are the first line; these are augmented with contextual help links inside the seller and buyer dashboards. Tiered human support is available via email and in-app chat; phone support is offered for premium sellers or critical financial disputes.

Support requests are triaged automatically using tags and routing rules: billing, shipping, order cancellations, fraud, and technical issues each map to specialized teams. Automated workflows enrich tickets with contextual metadata—order IDs, user history, and payment status—to reduce time-to-resolution. SLA targets are defined per priority level (e.g., urgent payment disputes vs. general queries) and monitored through internal dashboards.

For escalations, a formal review process includes root-cause analysis, customer outreach, and, if necessary, policy exceptions managed by a case review board. Shoplite maintains playbooks for common issues such as lost shipments, refunds, and account verification failures to ensure consistent handling.

Merchants have access to seller support channels with additional tools: bulk dispute responses, evidence submission for chargebacks, and dedicated account managers for high-volume or strategic sellers. Support interactions feed back into product and operations teams via an insights pipeline that identifies frequent pain points and drives improvements.

---

## Document 12: Mobile App Features

The Shoplite mobile application is designed to deliver a native, high-performance experience that mirrors the richness of the web storefront while optimizing for mobile-specific interactions. The app supports streamlined product discovery with personalized home feeds, curated collections, and fast search with predictive suggestions. Product pages are optimized for mobile with prominent imagery, swipable galleries, zoom and 360-degree views where available, and clear variant selectors that reduce misconfiguration at checkout. Core commerce flows—add to cart, one-tap buy, and checkout—are tuned for minimal friction.

Authentication experiences on mobile leverage device capabilities: biometric sign-in (fingerprint or face unlock) is supported for returning users, and session persistence is handled securely with refresh-token workflows that reduce the need for repeated logins while maintaining security best practices. Push notifications are used judiciously to provide transactional updates (order confirmations, shipment alerts) and personalized marketing (cart reminders, tailored promotions), with granular user controls for preferences and do-not-disturb windows.

The mobile app also enables mobile-specific features that improve conversion and engagement. Offline caching provides a lightweight catalog cache so product detail pages and carts remain usable in flaky networks; optimistic UI updates ensure responsive interactions while background sync resolves eventual consistency. Native payment integrations (Apple Pay, Google Pay) reduce checkout friction through tokenized, biometric-authorized payments. Location-aware features deliver localized content, nearest available shipping options, and quick address entry through native address pickers.

For sellers, a compact seller app experience focuses on core tasks: order processing, simple inventory updates, quick messaging with buyers, and shipment confirmation via barcode or QR scan where supported. The seller app surfaces performance alerts, low-stock warnings, and an actionable dashboard to manage priority tasks on the go. Offline support for sellers includes queueing updates when connectivity is restored.

From an engineering perspective, the mobile app is built with modular feature flags to enable progressive rollouts and A/B tests. Telemetry and crash reporting are integrated to measure performance metrics such as time-to-interactive, checkout conversion, and API latency, and to quickly triage regressions. Accessibility is prioritized—large tap targets, readable typography, screen reader labels, and color-contrast checks are baked into UI components. Overall, the Shoplite mobile experience aims to deliver speed, trust, and convenience while providing tools for both shoppers and sellers to manage commerce efficiently.

## Document 13: API Documentation for Developers

Shoplite’s developer API surface is designed to be comprehensive, secure, and predictable for integrators building storefronts, inventory sync tools, and fulfillment adapters. The public REST API exposes resource-centric endpoints for products, catalogs, inventory, orders, payments, and webhooks. Endpoints adhere to standard RESTful principles with clear status codes, pagination, and HATEOAS-style links where appropriate to ease navigation between related resources.

Authentication uses scoped API keys and OAuth 2.0 where delegated user consent is required. API keys are provisioned with granular permissions (read-only, order-write, inventory-write) and can be rotated programmatically. Rate limiting is enforced per key with clear headers to indicate quota and reset windows; premium tiers can request higher throughput for enterprise integrations. Webhooks deliver real-time event notifications for order creation, shipment updates, inventory changes, and chargebacks; payloads are signed and include replay-protection headers.

The API documentation provides interactive examples, schema definitions (OpenAPI/Swagger), code snippets in common languages, and SDK references for primary languages. Error responses are standardized with machine-readable error codes, human-friendly messages, and links to developer docs for remediation steps. For bulk operations, Shoplite supports batch imports and exports with idempotency keys to guard against duplicate processing.

Developer tooling includes a sandbox environment that mirrors production behaviors with seeded data and a test payment gateway to validate flows without real money. Comprehensive tutorials show common patterns: synchronizing inventory, handling partial refunds, implementing webhooks securely, and building storefront checkouts that integrate with Shoplite’s cart APIs. SDKs and CLI tools are maintained to simplify common tasks like bulk product uploads and log inspection.

Operational best practices are documented for partner developers: implement exponential backoff when retrying failed requests, validate webhook signatures, and design idempotent handlers for event delivery. Governance aspects—API deprecation schedules, versioning policies, and migration guides—are explicitly published to minimize integration friction. Overall, Shoplite’s API program is structured to support fast integrations while keeping security, observability, and developer productivity as first-class concerns.

---

## Document 14: Security and Privacy Policies

Shoplite’s security and privacy posture is grounded in minimizing risk while enabling commerce. The platform applies a principle of least privilege across systems and enforces role-based access controls (RBAC) for administrative functions. Sensitive data—payment instruments, personally identifiable information (PII), and authentication secrets—are handled according to compliance standards: payment data is tokenized via PCI-compliant vaults and PII is encrypted at rest with strict access controls and audit logging.

Privacy practices follow a data minimization approach: only the data necessary for a given business purpose is collected, retention windows are defined by data category (e.g., transactional vs. behavioral), and user-facing controls enable export and deletion requests in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations. Consent capture and cookie management are surfaced during onboarding and settings so users can control marketing preferences and data sharing.

Operational security includes regular vulnerability scanning, third-party dependency management, penetration testing, and a robust incident response program with documented runbooks. Secrets management is centralized; keys and credentials rotate periodically and use hardware-backed keystores where available. Network defenses include WAFs, DDoS mitigation, and layered perimeter controls, while application-layer protections enforce input validation, CSRF protections, and secure session handling.

Vendor risk management is part of the program: integrations with service providers (payment processors, identity verification, cloud services) are assessed for security posture and contractual safeguards. Security training and awareness programs are provided across engineering and operations teams.

Privacy and security incidents are handled with clear notification policies and legal oversight. Breach response includes forensic investigation, containment, communication to affected parties per regulatory requirements, and remediation plans. Continuous monitoring and SIEM tooling collect telemetry for anomaly detection. The security and privacy program aims to maintain customer trust by combining technical controls, policy governance, and transparent communication.

---

## Document 15: Promotional Codes and Discounts

Promotions and discounts are critical levers for both merchants and Shoplite’s growth strategy. The platform provides a flexible promotion engine that supports coupon codes, automatic promotions (e.g., buy-one-get-one), percentage- or fixed-amount discounts, and conditional rules such as minimum order value, product-category restrictions, and customer-segmentation targeting. Promotions can be configured at the global, seller, or product level and can stack or be mutually exclusive according to merchant-defined rules.

When a promotion is applied, Shoplite validates eligibility at cart addition and again during checkout to account for last-mile changes such as inventory adjustments, price updates, or exclusion rules. The promotion engine exposes priority ordering and conflict resolution strategies so merchants can control which offers take precedence. Campaign reporting provides redemption metrics, incremental revenue attribution, and ROI calculations to help merchants tune their promotional mix.

To prevent abuse, the promotion system supports constraints such as usage limits per customer, start and end dates, geographic restrictions, and eligibility lists (whitelists/blacklists). For targeted promotions, Shoplite integrates with customer segmentation and marketing automation systems to personalize offers based on lifecycle stage, purchase history, or engagement signals.

Operational integration points include coupon import/export APIs, auditing of promotion changes, and transactional logs for each redemption event to ensure financial reconciliation. For large-scale campaigns, promotions can be pre-evaluated in bulk jobs to compute expected discounts and inventory impact. The platform also supports dynamic promotions driven by machine-learning models that recommend offers in real time based on conversion probability and margin impact.

---

## Document 16: Seller Fulfillment and Shipping Options

Seller fulfillment on Shoplite is designed to be flexible to accommodate merchants of different sizes and capabilities. Sellers can configure fulfillment methods—merchant-fulfilled, third-party logistics (3PL), or Shoplite-fulfilled (where available)—with per-seller shipping profiles that define zones, carriers, rate calculations (flat, table-based, or carrier-calculated), and delivery promises. Sellers can map warehouses and inventory locations to route orders optimally based on proximity and shipping cost.

The platform supports integration with major carriers via APIs and with 3PL partners through EDI or API adapters. Shipping profiles allow sellers to set handling times, cut-off times for same-day processing, and rules for expedited shipping. For complex shipping needs, Shoplite supports multi-package shipments, parcel-level tracking, and customs documentation for cross-border orders.

Fulfillment orchestration handles routing logic for split orders, selecting fulfillment sources according to configurable rules (priority, proximity, inventory availability). Sellers can opt into Shoplite’s fulfillment services where Shoplite manages warehousing, pick-and-pack, and last-mile logistics; this offering includes SLAs, inventory management integrations, and dedicated support.

Operationally, fulfillment events are surfaced through webhooks and dashboards that allow sellers to track pick, pack, and ship stages. Exception handling workflows manage backorders, carrier failures, and customer-initiated changes. Sellers receive analytics on fulfillment performance—on-time rate, order cycle time, and fulfillment cost—that can be used to tune shipping profiles and fulfillment strategies.

---

## Document 17: Dispute Resolution and Chargebacks

Dispute resolution and chargeback management are critical to maintaining buyer trust and protecting seller balances. Shoplite provides tools to manage customer disputes, collect evidence, and respond to card issuer chargebacks. When a dispute arises, the platform aggregates relevant artifacts—order details, delivery confirmation, communication history, and return tracking—and presents a structured response workflow for sellers and support teams.

Chargeback handling includes timelines and escalation paths: once a chargeback notification is received from the payment processor, Shoplite assigns a case ID and begins evidence collection. Sellers can submit supporting documents through the dashboard; Shoplite’s case management system helps compose and submit evidence to the issuer in the format required, track the issuer’s decision, and apply balance adjustments depending on outcomes.

To reduce repetitive disputes, Shoplite provides proactive prevention tools: clearer product descriptions, shipment confirmation flows with signature capture, and pre-dispute outreach that attempts to resolve issues before a chargeback is filed. Dispute analytics identify repeat offenders, high-risk SKUs, and regions with disproportionate dispute rates to guide mitigation strategies.

Financial reconciliation ties dispute outcomes back to seller payouts and reserve balances. Persistent or fraudulent dispute patterns can trigger account-level controls including temporary holds, limits on payout scheduling, or manual review. Appeals processes enable sellers to contest platform-level decisions with additional evidence. Overall, the dispute resolution framework aims to be transparent, evidence-driven, and operationally efficient.

---

## Document 18: Data Retention and Audit Logs

Shoplite implements data retention and audit logging policies that balance operational needs with privacy and regulatory requirements. Transactional records required for accounting and legal compliance (orders, payments, shipping records) are retained according to jurisdictional guidance; non-essential analytics and behavioral logs follow shorter retention windows unless needed for active investigations or product analysis.

Audit logs capture administrative actions (user role changes, financial adjustments, and API key rotations) with immutable records including actor, timestamp, and contextual metadata. These logs support incident investigations, compliance audits, and internal accountability. Access to audit logs is restricted based on RBAC policies and is monitored for anomalous access patterns.

Retention policies are codified with automated lifecycle jobs that archive older data into cold storage or purge it when retention windows expire, with safeguards to prevent accidental deletion of data under legal hold. Data export and deletion workflows comply with data subject requests (DSARs) and are documented for internal teams to ensure timely responses.

For analytics and machine-learning use cases, Shoplite often anonymizes or pseudonymizes data before long-term storage, applying differential access controls and usage agreements to protect privacy. The platform also maintains tamper-evident mechanisms and checksum verification for archived datasets used in financial reconciliations.

---

## Document 19: Accessibility and Internationalization

Shoplite approaches accessibility and internationalization (i18n) as core product qualities rather than afterthoughts. The platform implements WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines where applicable—ensuring semantic markup, keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, and ARIA labels for interactive components. Accessibility testing is embedded into the QA process, and manual audits are performed for key user journeys to ensure screen reader compatibility and ease of use for assistive technologies.

Internationalization is supported end-to-end: content localization pipelines enable translators to manage copy in multiple locales, currency formats are localized, and date/time displays respect user locale settings. Pricing, tax calculation, and shipping rules are configurable per market to reflect local regulations and carrier availability. The platform supports right-to-left (RTL) layouts and locale-specific formatting for addresses and phone numbers.

Localization engineering includes context-aware translation keys, support for pluralization rules, and a review workflow that allows product managers and translators to preview changes in staging environments. Metric-driven checks monitor localization coverage and untranslated strings to prioritize work across markets. Together, accessibility and i18n workstreams help Shoplite reach more users and comply with region-specific legal requirements.

## Document 20: Fraud Prevention and Risk Management

Shoplite’s fraud prevention program combines deterministic rules with adaptive machine-learning risk scoring to protect buyers and sellers while minimizing false positives. The system collects signals at multiple stages—account creation, login, checkout, and post-purchase interactions—and enriches them with third-party risk data, device fingerprints, geolocation, and historical behavior patterns.

Real-time risk decisions use rule engines for high-confidence patterns (e.g., known bad IPs, velocity thresholds) and ML models trained to balance fraud detection with conversion impacts. The risk stack includes a risk API that returns recommended actions (approve, challenge, block) and a case management interface for analysts to investigate flagged transactions. Shoplite applies graduated responses: low-risk flags might trigger additional verification steps (2FA, email confirmation), while high-risk activity may result in immediate block and manual review.

Prevention strategies extend beyond detection: account hygiene (phone/email verification, device reputation), transaction throttling, and adaptive challenge flows help reduce attack surface. Post-transaction monitoring catches suspicious patterns like rapid returns or refunds, and the platform correlates signals across accounts to detect organized fraud rings.

Operationally, fraud and risk teams maintain runbooks for common scenarios, implement feedback loops to retrain models, and monitor key metrics such as false positive rate, chargeback ratio, and detection lead time. The program partners closely with legal and payments teams to align rules with policy and regulatory constraints. By combining automation with human review and continuous model improvement, Shoplite aims to limit fraud losses while preserving a smooth experience for legitimate users.
