## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

To create a Shoplite account, users visit the registration page and provide an email address, password, and basic profile information. Email verification is required within 24 hours of registration to activate the account. Users may choose either a buyer account (personal use) or a seller account (business use). Seller accounts require additional business verification steps including business name, tax ID, and proof of identity for the primary contact. Passwords must meet the platform's complexity rules: minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. For password resets, Shoplite sends a one-time link valid for 15 minutes. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is available and recommended for seller accounts. Account deletion is handled through the account settings page and requires confirmation and a short survey.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

The Shoplite shopping cart allows users to add items from multiple sellers, save items for later, and apply promotional codes at checkout. The cart is persisted for authenticated users across devices and sessions. When users are not signed in, the cart is stored in a browser cookie and will be merged into the user's account upon login. The cart displays per-seller shipping estimates and automatically groups items by seller to simplify checkout. Coupon codes are validated at the time of addition and again before charging to ensure eligibility (minimum order value, product exclusions, and expiry). The cart supports quantity updates, per-item notes for sellers, and a save-for-later feature.

## Document 3: Shoplite Checkout and Payment Flow

Checkout on Shoplite guides users through address confirmation, shipping selection, payment method, and final review. Shoplite supports credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and platform gift credit. Payment information is tokenized and stored with a PCI-compliant payment provider; the platform never stores full card numbers. The order review page displays estimated taxes and shipping fees before confirmation. For sellers, payouts are scheduled based on the seller agreement (net-7 standard) and subject to holds for new sellers until verification completes. The checkout flow supports guest checkout but encourages account creation for saved payment methods and faster repeat purchases.

---

## Document 4: Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite integrates with PCI-compliant payment processors and supports major credit card networks and digital wallets. All sensitive payment data is tokenized. Fraud prevention is managed via a combination of device fingerprinting, velocity checks, and risk scoring; suspicious transactions are flagged for review and may require additional verification. Refunds must follow the platform refund policy and are processed through the same payment provider; reversed transactions are reconciled against seller payouts.

---

## Document 5: Order Tracking and Delivery

After order confirmation, Shoplite provides order tracking with estimated delivery dates. Tracking integrates with carrier APIs and updates status (shipped, in transit, out for delivery, delivered). Customers receive email updates and can view tracking in their order history. Delivery exceptions (lost or delayed packages) trigger a customer support workflow and may lead to refunds or replacement orders depending on seller policies.

---

## Document 6: Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite provides a standard 30-day return window for most items, subject to seller-specific exceptions. Buyers must request a return authorization through the order page, print a return label (if provided), and ship items following the instructions. Returns are inspected by sellers upon receipt. Refunds are issued to the original payment method after inspection and may take several business days to post due to payment provider settlement.

---

## Document 7: Product Reviews and Ratings

Customers can leave reviews and star ratings after order delivery. Reviews must follow community guidelines (no hate speech, personal data, or promotional content). Shoplite uses a moderation pipeline combining automated filters (spam detection, profanity) and manual review for flagged content. Verified purchase badges help buyers identify authentic reviews. Sellers may respond to reviews but cannot remove reviews directly; removal requires a support request and moderation team decision.

---

## Document 8: Seller Account Setup and Management

Sellers sign up through a dedicated onboarding flow that collects business information, bank details, and tax documents. New sellers undergo identity and business verification which may include document upload and manual review. Seller dashboards provide inventory management, order fulfillment status, payout history, and performance analytics. Sellers must comply with platform policies including prohibited items and content guidelines. Account suspension policies are outlined in the seller agreement.

---

## Document 9: Inventory Management for Sellers

Sellers manage SKU-level inventory through the dashboard or API. Inventory updates support bulk CSV uploads and a REST API for programmatic updates. Low-stock alerts help sellers restock popular items. The platform supports per-variation inventory (size/color) and synchronization with external systems via webhooks. Sellers can set backorder rules and auto-replenishment thresholds.

---

## Document 10: Commission and Fee Structure

Shoplite charges sellers a commission on each sale plus optional listing fees for promotional placements. Commission rates vary by category and are disclosed during seller onboarding. Fees are deducted before seller payouts. Promotional campaigns and advertising placements are billed separately and appear on seller invoices.

---

## Document 11: Customer Support Procedures

Shoplite offers multi-channel customer support: in-app chat, email, and phone support for premium sellers. The support team uses a triage system to route issues to the right team (billing, shipping, fraud). Common request types include order tracking, refunds, and account disputes. SLA targets vary by issue priority; critical payment-related issues are triaged faster.

---

## Document 12: Mobile App Features

The Shoplite mobile app supports browsing, push notifications for order updates, a streamlined checkout, and fingerprint/face unlock for faster sign-in. The app supports saved payment methods, wish lists, and localized content. Developers must follow platform guidelines for background sync and push notification handling.

---

## Document 13: API Documentation for Developers

Shoplite exposes REST APIs for product management, orders, and webhooks. API keys are issued to developers and must be stored securely. Rate limits apply per API key. Webhooks allow sellers to receive real-time notifications for order events, inventory updates, and disputes.

---

## Document 14: Security and Privacy Policies

Shoplite follows standard privacy practices: minimize data collection, retain only necessary data for business purposes, and provide users with controls to export or delete their data. Security measures include TLS encryption in transit, role-based access controls, and regular penetration testing. Sensitive personal information is stored only when necessary and is protected with access controls and auditing.

---

## Document 15: Promotional Codes and Discounts

Merchants can create promotional codes with restrictions (percentage or fixed amount, minimum order value, expiry date, and product/category restrictions). Shoplite validates codes at checkout and supports stacking rules defined by merchants. Analytics for campaigns include redemption rates and incremental revenue attribution.

---

## Document 16: Seller Fulfillment and Shipping Options

Sellers choose between merchant-fulfilled shipping and third-party logistics options. Shipping profiles can be configured per seller with zone-based rates, flat rates, or calculated carrier rates. Fulfillment options affect delivery estimates shown to buyers and may influence search ranking for fast-shipping filters.

---

## Document 17: Dispute Resolution and Chargebacks

Chargebacks are handled according to payment provider policies. Shoplite provides sellers with evidence collection tools to respond to disputes. The platform mediate disputes between buyers and sellers and may hold funds until disputes are resolved.

---

## Document 18: Data Retention and Audit Logs

Shoplite retains audit logs for key account actions and administrative operations for 90 days by default. Data retention policies for transactional data are longer (defined by legal/compliance teams) and may vary by jurisdiction.

---

## Document 19: Accessibility and Internationalization

Shoplite aims to meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) for core flows and supports multiple locales and currencies. Localized content and translations are provided for major markets, and currency conversion is shown during checkout.

---

## Document 20: Fraud Prevention and Risk Management

Fraud prevention combines rule-based checks and machine-learning risk scoring. High-risk orders are flagged and may require manual review or additional customer verification. The fraud detection system integrates with payment providers and external data sources for identity verification.
